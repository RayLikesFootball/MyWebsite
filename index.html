        <p id="p1" style="font-size: 20px" >The phenomenon, which can be observed all over the world today, is called Graffiti Art. It all started in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on the turn of the late 60's with writers like Cornbread and Cool Earl. The movement took on very quickly in New York City and names and nicknames started to appear on buildings, post-boxes, phone boxes, underground tunnels, buses and finally on subway cars. Taki 183, whose name was to be seen all over NY, gave an interview to The New York Times in 1971. Takiâ€™s real name was Zavy, ### is the number of the street where he lived.
        This young greek boy wrote his name almost everywhere during his work hours as a messenger.
        he didnt care what they had to say he wantsted to show the world who he was and he wanted to be rembered in such a way by spray painting.</p>

    <h2> This is Expressing My Creativity through works of Art.</h2>
    <p id="p2" style="font-size: 26px">The interest in showing graffiti on canvas has developed as soon as graffiti sprayed in the city. In 1972, Hugo Martinez, sociology major at City College in New York took notice of the legitimate artistic potential of the early graffiti writers generation.</p>
